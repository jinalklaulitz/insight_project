## Introduction  
Airflow is used to run the scripts found across the repo. It's primarily used for invoking the twitch API, retrieving video category metadata (since it's not included in the same api call), Spark, Redshift and Kafka Scripts. 

## System setup
Airflow is only a single M4L EC2 instance.
